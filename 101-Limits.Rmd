## Understand limits using tangent lines

Intuitively, the limit of a function $f$ at $x=a$ is a fixed value $L$ that values of the function $f(x)$ approach as the values of $x$ $(\ne a)$ approach $a$.

The slope of a tangent line to the graph of a functions is a limit of slopes of secant lines. This can be visualized easily using Maple with the support of the package `Student[Calculus1]`.

Like predefined functions in Maple, package consists of predefine commands for Maple. The package `Student` serves for studying Calculus and other subject interactively. The subpackage `Student[Calculus1]` focus mainly on Calculus as the name indicated.

As different package has different focus and serves for different purpose, Maple won't load a specific package until you run the command `with(package_name)`. For example, the command
`with(Student[Calculus1])` will load the subpackage `Calculus1`.

```{example}

Observe how do secant lines of the function  $f(x)=x^3-2$ approach to the tangent line at $x=1$.

```

```{solution}
Load the `Student[Calculus1]` package using `with()`.

    with(Student[Calculus1])

Use `TangentSecantTutor` from the loaded package to observe changes of secant lines.

    TangentSecantTutor(x^3-1, x=1)

```

```{exercise}
Explore the package `Student`, in particular the subpackage `Student[Calculus1]`.
You can use the command `?Student` to get help.

Find the slope of the tangent line to the function $f(x)=2x^3+\frac1{x^2}$ at $x=1$ using the `TangentSecantTutor` command.
```

## Estimate limits numerically or graphically

To estimate a limit $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$ numerically, one may pick some values close to $a$ and evaluate the function. In Maple, the calculation can be done by using the repetition statement `for counter in array do statement end to;`.

```{example}
Estimate the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}$ by approximations.
```

```{solution}
First, we pick some values close to 0, for example -0.99, -0.999, -0.9999, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and assign them to an expression.

    sq:= [-0.99, -0.999, -0.9999, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]

Now we find the function values using two new commands instead of defining the function a priori.

    for t in sq do evalf(subs(x=t, sin(x)/x)) end do;

```

Graphs provide visual intuition which helps understand and solve problems. Recall, the command `plot(expression, domain, option)` produces a graph of the function defined by the expression over your choice of domain.

```{example}
Determine whether the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{1- \cos x}$ exists.
```

```{solution}
Apply the `plot` function to the expression over the domain $(-0.5, 0.5)$.

    plot(1/(1-cos(x)), x=-0.5..0.5)

The graph shows that the function $y=\frac{1}{1- \cos x}$ goes to $\infty$ when $x$ approaches $0$. So the limit is an infinite limit.
```

```{exercise}
Estimate the limit $\lim\limits_{t \to 0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x}$ numerically.
```

```{exercise}
Determine whether the limit $\lim\limits_{x \to 1}\frac{\sin x}{|x-1|}$ exists using the graph.
```

## Evaluate limits

Maple provides the following command to evaluate a limit

```
limit(function, position, direction)
```

The direction may be omitted when evaluating a two-side limit.

```{example}
Determine whether the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{|x|}{x}$ exists.
```

```{solution}
You may find the left and right limits using the following commands.

    limit(abs(x)/x, x=0, left)
    limit(abs(x)/x, x=0, right)

It turns out that $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{|x|}{x}$ does not exist because the left limit and the right limit are different.
```

```{example}
Evaluate the limit $\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, where $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x}$.
```

```{solution}
The limit can be obtained using the following command.

    limit((1/(x+h)-1/x)/h, x=0)

```

```{exercise}
Determine whether the limit $\lim\limits_{x\to 1/2}\dfrac{2x-1}{|2x^3-x^2|}$ exists.
```

```{exercise}
Evaluate the limit $\lim\limits_{t\to 0}\dfrac{\sqrt{x+t}-\sqrt{x}}{t}$.
```

## Learn limit laws using `LimitTutor`

Suppose the limits of two functions $f$ and $g$ at the same point $x=a$ exist (equal finite numbers). Then the limit operation commutes with addition/subtraction, multiplication/division and power.

In Maple, you may use the command `LimitTutor(function, position, direction)`, which is again supported by the subpackage `Student[Calculus1]`,  to learn how to evaluate a limit using limit laws and theorems.

```{example}
Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{1-\cos x}{x}$.
```

```{solution}
Load the subpackage `Student[Calculus1]` if it was not loaded.

    with(Student[Calculus1])

Use the following command to learn how to evaluate the limit.

    LimitTutor(2-x^3, x=2,'right')

You will see an interactive windows pop out.  You can choose the see the procedure step-by-step.
```

```{exercise}
Evaluate $\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{(x+2)(\cos x-1)}{x^2-x}$ using `LimitTutor`.
```

## Squeeze Theorem

Comparison is a very useful tool in problem solving. Squeeze theorem is such an example

```{theorem, name="Squeeze Theorem"}
Suppose that
$$
f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)
$$
and
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=L=\lim\limits_{x\to c}h(x).
$$
Then
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to c}g(x)=L.
$$
```

Let's use Maple to understand the statement.

```{example}
Graph the functions $f(x)=-x$, $g(x)=x\cos\frac1x$ and $h(x)=x$ in the same coordinate system. What's the limit of $g(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$.
```

```{solution}
We use the `plot()` command to graph the functions together.

    plot([-x, x*cos(1/x), x], x=-1..1, discont, color=[red, blue, red])

![Squeeze Theorem demonstration](figs/squeeze.png)

From the graph, we see that the $\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)=0$ as it is squeezed by two limits which are both $0$.

```

```{exercise}

Graph the functions $f(x)=-x$, $g(x)=x\sin\frac1x$ and $h(x)=x$ in the same coordinate system. What's the limit of $g(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$.

```

## Continuity

A function $f$ is continuous at $x=a$ if $f(a)$ is defined and $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$. Intuitively, a function is continuous if the graph has no hole or jump.

```{example}

Use graph to determine if the function
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
    x & x\le -1 \\
    1/(x-1) & -1<x<1\\
    3-x & 1<x\le 2\\
    \sin(x - 2) + 1 & x>2\\
    -2 & x=2
\end{cases}
$$
is continuous over $(-\infty, \infty)$. Find the discontinuities and verify them using the definition and properties of continuity.

```

```{solution}

First we define the function.

    f := x -> piecewise(x <= -1, x, -1 < x and x < 1, 1/(x - 1), 1 <= x and x < 2, 3 - x, 2 < x, sin(x - 2) + 1, -2)

We first check visually whether the graph has holes or jumps.

    plot(f(x), discont = [showremovable], x = -5 .. 5, smartview = true)

In the above command, the option `discont = [showremovable]`  is used to show removable discontinuities.

![An example shows three types of discontinuities](figs/Discontinuities.png)

From the graph, we can tell that the function has discontinuities which can also be found using Maple.

    discont(f(x), x)

Maple gives three discontinuities $\{-1, 1, 2\}$.

Let's first find limits at all three values.

    discontset:=[-1, 1, 2]
    for a in discontset do limit(f(x), x=a) end do

You will find that limits do not exist at $-1$ and $1$. The limit at $2$ is $1$.
However, $g(2)=-2$. So $f$ has three discontinuities at $x=-1$, $x=1$ and $x=2$.

```

```{exercise}
Determine if the function
$$
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
    -x^2+2 & x\le 1 \\
    \tan x& 1<x<\pi/2\\
    2\cos x-1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
is continuous over $(-\infty, \infty)$.
Find all discontinuities if they exist and verify them using the definition.
```

## Continuity and Limit of a Composite Function

Continuous functions behave under composition. The composition of continuous functions is still continuous over its domain. More generally,

```{theorem}
Let $f$ be a function continuous at $x=L$. Suppose that $\lim\limits_{x\to c}g(x)=L$. Then
$$
\lim{x\to c}f(g(x))=f(L).
$$
```

In general, the limit does not commute with composition.

```{example}

Let
$$
f(x)=x^3\quad \text{and}\quad
g(x)=
\begin{cases}
1 & x=0\\
2x-1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Verify that
$$
\lim_{x\to 0}f(g(x))=f(\lim_{x\to 0}g(x)).
$$

Is is true that
$$
\lim_{x\to 0}g(f(x))=g(\lim_{x\to 0}f(x))?
$$
```

```{solution}
We first define $f$ and $g$ in Maple

    f:=x->x^2
    g:=x->piecewise(x=0, 0, x+2)

Evaluate limits for $f\circ g$.

    limit(f(g(x)), x=0)
    f(limit(g(x), x=0))

The results verify that the limit commutes with composition if the outside function is continuous.

Evaluate limits for $g\circ f$

    limit(f(g(x)), x=0)
    f(limit(g(x), x=0))

The results show that the limit may not commute with composition if the outside function is not continuous.

```

```{exercise}
Find three functions $f$, $g$, $h$ and a value $c$ such that $f(g(x))$ is continuous,
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(h(x))=f(\lim\limits_{x\to c}h(x))
$$
and
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to c}h(g(x))\neq h(\lim\limits_{x\to c}g(x)).
$$

```

## Intermediate Value Theorem

A very important result about continuity is the intermediate value theorem (IVT for short).

```{theorem, name="Intermediate Value Theorem"}
Let $f$ be a function continuous over the interval $[a, b]$. Suppose that $f(a)\neq f(b)$ and $N$ is a number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c\in (a, b)$ such that $f(c)=N$.

In particular, if $f(a)f(b)<0$ then there exists a number $c$ such that $f(c)=0$.

```

```{example}

Determine whether the equation
$$
\sin^2x + 2x - 1=0
$$
has the solution in $(-1, 1)$. Estimate the solution if it exists.

```

```{solution}

We first use the left hand side of the equation to define a function $eql$.

eql:=x->sin(x)^2 + 2*x - 1

Now lets verify that $eql$ is continuous over $[-1,1]$ using the command `iscont()`.

    iscont(eql(x), x=-1..1)

The result is `True`. We may apply the IVT. Let's check if the value $eql(-1)\cdot eql(1)<0$.

    evalf(eql(-1)*eql(1))

Here `evalf()` convert the symbolic answer to the (approximate) numerical value.

Since the product is negative, applying the IVT, we know there exists a solution between $(-1, 1)$.

This can also be seen from the graph using the command.

    plot(eql(x), x=-1..1)


To estimate the solution, you may use the Maple command

    evalf(solve(eql(x) = 0, x))

or you may repeatedly apply IVT to find an approximate solution.

    m:=10;
    a:=-1;
    b:=1;
    for n from 1 to m do
        c[n] := (a + b)/2;
        if evalf(eql(c[n])*eql(a)) < 0 then
            b := c[n];
        else
            a := c[n];
        end if;
        evalf(eql(c[n]));
    end do;

```

```{exercise}

Find an integer $k$ such that the equation
$$
\cos^2x + 3x - 2=0
$$
has a solution in $(k, k+1)$. Estimate the solution.
