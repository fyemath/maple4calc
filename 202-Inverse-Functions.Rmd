# Calculus of Inverse Functions

## Inverse Functions

Maple package `Student[Calculus1]` provides the following command

```maple
InversePlot(f(x), x = a..b);
```

which graphs the original function $f(x)$ and the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ together over the interval $[a, b]$.

You will see clearly that the graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$.

```{example}
  
1. Graph the function $f(x)=x^3-2$, its inverse function, and the line $y=x$ over the interval $[-2,2]$.

2. Find the inverse function.

```

```{solution}

One way to plot the function and its inverse together is to use the following command which is supported by the package `Student[Calculus1]`.

      InversePlot(x^3-3, x = -2..2)

Here is the output in Maple

Another way to plot the function $f$ and its inverse $g$ together uses the `plot` function.

      plot([f(x), g(x), x], x = -2 .. 4, y = -5 .. 5, color = [red, black, blue])

To find the inverse function, we replace $f(x)$ by $y$, then switch $x$ and $y$, and solve for $y$. In Maple, you may use the command `solve(equation/inequality, variable)` to solve an equation or an inequality (even system of equations/inequalities).

In this example, we may find the inverse function by type in the following command. Note I have switch $x$ and $y$.

    solve(x=y^3, y)

```

To find the derivative of the inverse function of a function $f$ at a given point $x=a$, we may apply the formula
$$(f^{-1})'(a)=\dfrac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(a))}.$$
In Maple, we may use the following commands to calculate the value of the derivative function.

- Calculate the derivative of the function $f$.

```maple

diff(f(x), x)

```

- Find $f^{-1}(a)$ which is the solution of the equaiton $f(x)=a$.

```maple

solve(f(x)=a, x)

```

- Plug in the formula to evaluate.

```maple

eval(subs(x=f^{-1}(a), 1/f'(x)))

```

```{example}

Find $(f^{-1})'(0)$, where $f(x)=\cos(x)$ and $0\leq x\leq \pi$.

```

```{solution}

Find the derivative of $f$
  
    diff(cos(x), x)

Find the value of $f^{-1}(0)$
  
    solve(cos(x)=0, x)

Apply the formula

    eval(subs(x=Pi/2, -1/sin(x)))

Using Maple, we find $(f^{-1})'(0)=-1$.

```

```{exercise}

1. Graph the function $f(x)=3+2\sin x$, its inverse function, and the line $y=x$ over the interval $[-2,2]$.

2. Find the value $(f^{-1})'(5)$.

```

## Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

### Basic properties and graphs

The natural logarithmic function $y=\ln(x)$ is defined by $\ln(x)=\int_1^x\frac{1}{t}\mathrm{d} t$.

The natural exponential function $y=e^x$ is defined as the inverse function of $y=\ln(x)$.

From the definition, we have very important identities
$$
\ln(e^x)=x\qquad \text{and}\qquad e^{\ln x}=x.
$$

Using those two identities, we may define general exponential functions and general logarithmic function, and deduce the Law of Logarithms and Law of Exponents.

- For any positive number $b\ne 1$, we have $b^x=(e^{\ln b})^x=e^{x\ln b}$.

- For any positive number $b\ne 1$, we define $y=\log_bx$ to be the inverse function of $y=b^x$

- By solving $x=b^y$ for $y$, we find that $\log_bx=\dfrac{\ln x}{\ln b}$. This identity is called the change of base property.

How do graphs of logarithmic functions and exponential functions look like?

```{example}

Graph the following functions together.
$$
y=\ln x, \qquad y=e^x, \qquad y=2^x, \qquad y=\log_2x, y=x.
$$

```

```{solution}

In Maple, the logarithm $\log_bx$ is given by `log[b](x)`. When $b=e$, you simply use `ln(x)` for $\ln x$. When $b=10$, you may also use `log(x)` or `log10(x)` for $\log_{10}x$.

The exponent $b^x$ is given by `b^x` in Maple. When $b=e$, you may also use `exp(x)` to represent $e^x$.

To graph the functions together with different colors, we use the following command

    plot([ln(x), exp(x), 2^x, log[2](x), x], x=-5..5, color=[blue, green, purple, yellow, red])

Here is the output

$$
y=\log_3x, \qquad y=3^x, \qquad y=(1/3)^x, \qquad y=\log_{1/3}x.
$$

```

$$

Describe the monotonicity (increasing/decreasing) of the functions?

$$

### Differentiation and integration of logarithmic and exponential functions

In Maple, one way to do differentiation and integration is to use the `Calculus Palette` on the left side.

![Calculus Palette in Maple](figs/Calculus-Palette.png){width=50%}

The other way is to use the commands `diff(f(x), x)` , `int(f(x), x)`, and `int(f(x), x=a..b)`.

Supported by the `Student[Calculus1]` package, Maple also provides the tutor commands `DiffTutor()` and `IntTutor()` which can show step-by-step solution of differentiation and integration.

Note you may also access tutor commands from the `Start` page (click the home button in the toolbar and look for Calculus).

```{example}

Find $y'$, where $y=\ln \left(x^{3}+5x+1\right)$.

```

```{solution}

Using `diff`:

    diff(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x)

We get
$$
y'=\dfrac{3x^{2}+5}{x^{3}+5 x+1}.
$$

Type in (assume that `with(Student[Calculus1])` was run)

    DiffTutor(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x)

and hit enter you will see

![DiffTutor Example](figs/DiffTutor-ex.png){width=50%}

By click `Next Step` or `All Steps` you will see detailed solution with rules used.

```

```{example}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int\dfrac{e^x-1}{e^x+1}\mathrm{d} x.
$$

```

```{solution}

Using `int`:

    int((exp(x)-1)/(exp(x)+1), x)

We get
$$
\int\dfrac{e^x-1}{e^x+1}\mathrm{d} x=2 \ln \left(\mathrm{e}^{x}+1\right)- x+C.
$$

Type in (assume that `with(Student[Calculus1])` was run)

    IntTutor((exp(x)-1)/(exp(x)+1), x)

and hit enter you will see

![IntTutor Example](figs/IntTutor-ex.png){width=50%}

By click `Next Step` or `All Steps` you will see detailed solution with rules used.

```

```{exercise}

Find the derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}$, where $y=\ln|\cos x|$

```

```{exercise}

Find the derivative $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} x}$, where $y=x^{\cos x}$

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int \frac{\left(e^{4x}+e^{2x}\right)}{e^{3x}} d x
$$

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int 2^{3x} d x
$$

```

## Solve differential equations

In Maple, you may solve the equation $y'(x)=k y(x) + c$ (which is called an ODE) using the command `dsolve({ics, eq})`, where `ics` stands for initial condition $y(0)=c$ and `eq` stands for the differential equation. Without the `ics`, `dsolve` will provide a general solution.

```{example}
Find the function $f(x)$ which satisfies the differential equation $f'(x)=k f(x)$ with $f(0)=5$ and $f(2)=3$.

```

```{solution}

Use the following command

    dsolve({f(0)=5, f'(x)=k f(x)})

we get $f(x)=5e^{kx}$.

To find $k$, we solve the equation $3=5e^{2k}$ by

    solve(3=5*e^(2*k), k)

which shows that $k=\frac{\ln3-\ln5}{2}\approx -0.255$.
Here we use `evalf(%)` (% represents the previous result) to get the approximation.

So the function $f$ is given by
$$
f(x)=5e^{\frac{x(\ln3-\ln5)}{2}}\approx 5e^{-0.255x}.
$$

```

```{exercise}

Find the function $y$ which satisfies the  differential equation $y'(x)=k y(x)$ with $y(0)=2$ and $y(5)=11$.

```

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions

### Domains and Ranges

To define the inverse function, the original function must be a one-to-one function.
For a trigonometric function, we have to restrict the function over a specific domain to ensure that the function is one-to-one.
For simplicity, we pick domains near the origin for trigonometric functions. To be more precise, we consider the following trigonometric functions:
$$
y=\sin x,\quad -\pi/2\leq x\leq \pi/2 ~~\text{and}~ -1\leq y\leq 1;
$$

$$
y=\cos x,\quad 0\leq x\leq \pi ~~\text{and}~ -1\leq y\leq 1;
$$

$$
y=\tan x,\quad -\pi/2< x< \pi/2 ~~\text{and}~ -\infty<y<\infty.
$$

Their inverse functions are

$$
y=\arcsin x,\quad -\pi/2\leq y\leq \pi/2 ~~\text{and}~ -1\leq x\leq 1;
$$

$$
y=\arccos x,\quad 0\leq y\leq \pi ~~\text{and}~ -1\leq x\leq 1;
$$

$$
y=\arctan x,\quad -\pi/2< y< \pi/2 ~~\text{and}~ -\infty< x<\infty.
$$

To see the graphs of the functions, we may use the `plot(f(x), x = a..b, opts)` command. Or, to graph $f$, $f^{-1}$ and $y=x$ together, we may also use the command `InversePlot(f(x), x = a..b, opts)` supported by the package `Student[Calculus1]`.

```{example}

Graph the following functions together.
$$
y=\tan x, \qquad y=\arctan x, \qquad y=x.
$$

```

```{solution}

    #load the package ``Student[Calculus1]".
    with(Student[Calculus1])
    #plot the functions
    InversePlot(tan(x),x=-Pi/2..Pi/2)

Here is the output

![Tangent and arctangent functions](figs/InversePlot_tanx.png){width=50%}

```

```{exercise}

Graph the following functions together over an appropriate domain.
$$
y=\cot x, \qquad y=\mathrm{arccot} x, \qquad y=x.
$$

What's the domain and range of $y=\mathrm{arccot} x$?

```

### Differentiation and integration of inverse trigonometric functions

In the section {#Differentiation and integration of logarithmic and exponential functions}, we learned to how use Maple to learn differentiation and integration.

Now let find derivatives and integrals of some inverse trigonometric functions.

```{example}

Find $y'$, where $y=\mathrm{arccot} x$.

```

```{solution}

Surely, we may use `diff` or `DiffTutor` to find the derivative.

Here let's me introduce to you another command `implicitdiff`.

We've learned that (see {#Inverse Functions}) to find the inverse function, we switch $x$ and $y$ and then solve for $y$. When finding the derivative, we don't have to solve for $y$ instead, we want $y'$ which is implicitly defined by an equation. In this case, we have $x=\mathrm{arccot}y$.

Enter the following commands in Maple, you will find $y'=-\frac{1}{x^2+1}$.

    implicitdiff(x=cot(y), y, x)
    subs(cot(y) = x, %)

where `%` is a ditto operator that allows you to refer to a previously computed result in Maple.

```

```{exercise}

Find the derivative of $y=\mathrm{arcsec} x$

```

```{exercise}

Find the derivative of $y=\mathrm{arccsc} x$

```

For integrals of inverse trigonometric function, you may need the method of integration by parts.

Use `DiffTutor` to find antiderivatives of inverse trigonometric functions.

```{exercise}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int \arcsin x \mathrm{d} x
$$

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int \arctan x \mathrm{d} x
$$

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the integral
$$
\int \mathrm{sec} x \mathrm{d} x
$$

```

## L'Hospital's Rule

In Maple, supported by the package, `Student[Calculus1]`, the command `LimitTutor` can show step-by-step solutions of evaluating limits.

```{example}

Evaluate the limit
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to \infty}(1+x)^{1/\ln(x)}
$$

```

```{solution}

    # load the package Student[Calculus1].
    with(Student[Calculus1])
    #Find the limit step-by-step using LimitTutor
    LimitTutor((1+x)^(1/ln(x)), x = infinity)

```

```{exercise}

Estimate the limit
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to 1}\frac{x^2-2x+1}{x^2-x}
$$
by graphing and verify your estimation.

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the limit
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to \infty} x-\ln(x).
$$

```

```{exercise}

Evaluate the limit
$$
\lim\limits_{x\to \infty} x\tan(\frac1x).
$$

```
