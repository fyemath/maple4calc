Maple start page screen shot with Calculus highlighted If you click the Calculus icon on the Start page and click OK, you will see the following document. Maple Calculus document page screen shot 1.2 Basic Operators The first thing to know when learn something new is where and how to get help. In Maple, you may simply type ?keyword to open a help page (a new window). For example, the command ?operators will lead you to descriptions of arithmetic operators in Maple. addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation Maple Operators + - * / ^ In writing \\(x+2\\) \\(a-b\\) \\(2x\\) \\(\\dfrac pq\\) \\(b^5\\) In Maple x+2 a-b 2*x p/q b^5 1.3 How to define a function A function is an assignment, for a given input \\(x\\), we assignment an output \\(y\\) under a certain rule. Maple take this idea to define functions. The command to define a function has the following form. function name:= independent variable -&gt; function rule Here := means “defined/assigned to be” and -&gt; may be understood as “plug in”. Example 1.1 Define the following function in Maple and find the value \\(f(0.999)\\). \\[ f(x)=\\dfrac{x}{x-1} \\] Solution. The function name is \\(f\\), the independent variable is \\(x\\) and the function rule is \\(\\dfrac{x}{x-1}\\). So the function can be defined in Maple by the following command. f:=x-&gt;x/(x-1) Once the function is define, you may find the function value by the command f(0.999). Exercise 1.1 Define the following function in Maple and find the value \\(f(2.0001)\\). \\[ g(x)=\\dfrac{x^3}{(x-2)^2} \\] Remark. The assignment operator := to the left-hand side the value of the right-hand side. The left-hand side normally is a name and the right-hand side is a value or expression. 1.4 Initially known mathematical functions Maple has many predefined functions which can be used to create new functions. To see all initially known mathematical functions in maple, you may use the help command ?functions and click the hyperlinked “initial functions” in the description shown in the new window. Maple function help page screenshot Some frequently used functions are listed in tables below. absolute value square root n-th root natural exponential logarithmic abs() sqrt() surd(,n) exp() log(),log[b](), ln() sine cosine tangent cotangent secant cosecant sin() cos() tan() cot() sec() csc() inverse sine inverse cosine inverse tangent inverse cotangent inverse secant inverse cosecant arcsin() arccos() arctan() arccot() arcsec() arccsc() Another initially know function that we will use is the piecewise function. piecewise(condition1, expression1, condition2, expression2, expression3) Example 1.2 Define the following function in Maple and evaluate \\(pwf(3)\\) \\[ pwf(x) = \\begin{cases} \\sqrt{\\sin(x)} &amp; x&lt;-1\\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x}}{|x+2|} &amp; -1\\leq x&lt;\\pi\\\\ \\ln(e^x+2) &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases} \\] Solution. The function can be defined by the following command. pwf:=x-&gt;piecewise(x&lt;-1, sqrt(sin(x)), x&gt;=-1 and x&lt;Pi, surd(x, 3)/abs(x+2), ln(exp(x)+2)) The value \\(pwf(3)\\) can be obtained by the command pwf(3). Exercise 1.2 Define the following function in Maple and evaluate \\(q(1)\\) \\[ q(x) = \\begin{cases} |x-2|/\\sqrt{x} &amp; x&gt;\\dfrac{pi}{2}\\\\ (x-1)\\tan(x) &amp; 0\\leq x&lt; \\dfrac{\\pi}{2}\\\\ \\sqrt[5]{\\log_2(1+e^x)} &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] 1.5 Plot functions In Maple, you may plot a single variable function easily using the command plot(expression, domain, options) or plot several single variable functions together using plot([experssion1, experssion2], domain, options) In the command, options may be omitted, but the domain must be given. To see details about available options, you may run the command ?plot in Maple. Example 1.3 Plot the functions \\(f(x)=x^2\\) in red and \\(l(x)=2x+1\\) in blue over the domain \\([-1, 2]\\). Solution. Here are the command and the output plot([x^2, 2*x+1], x=-1..2, color=[red, blue]) Screen shot of the output generated by plotting of two function Exercise 1.3 Plot the piecewise function in Exercise over the domain \\([-2, 4]\\). Exercise 1.4 Plot the functions \\(f(x)=\\ln(x+5)\\) and \\(g(x)=3\\cos(2x+1)+4\\) over the domain \\([-\\pi, \\pi]\\). "],

The slope of a tangent line to the graph of a functions is a limit of slopes of secant lines. This can be visualized easily using Maple with the support of the package Student[Calculus1]. Like predefined functions in Maple, package consists of predefine commands for Maple. The package Student serves for studying Calculus and other subject interactively. The subpackage Student[Calculus1] focus mainly on Calculus as the name indicated. As different package has different focus and serves for different purpose, Maple won’t load a specific package until you run the command with(package_name). For example, the command with(Student[Calculus1]) will load the subpackage Calculus1. Example 2.1 Observe how do secant lines of the function \\(f(x)=x^3-2\\) approach to the tangent line at \\(x=1\\). Solution. Load the Student[Calculus1] package using with(). with(Student[Calculus1]) Use TangentSecantTutor from the loaded package to observe changes of secant lines. TangentSecantTutor(x^3-1, x=1) Exercise 2.1 Explore the package Student, in particular the subpackage Student[Calculus1]. You can use the command ?Student to get help. Find the slope of the tangent line to the function \\(f(x)=2x^3+\\frac1{x^2}\\) at \\(x=1\\) using the TangentSecantTutor command. 2.2 Estimate limits numerically or graphically To estimate a limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)\\) numerically, one may pick some values close to \\(a\\) and evaluate the function. In Maple, the calculation can be done by using the repetition statement for counter in array do statement end to;. Example 2.2 Estimate the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\) by approximations. Solution. First, we pick some values close to 0, for example -0.99, -0.999, -0.9999, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and assign them to an expression. sq:=[-0.99, -0.999, -0.9999, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01] Now we find the function values using two new commands instead of defining the function a priori. for t in sq do evalf(subs(x=t, sin(x)/x)) end do; Graphs provide visual intuition which helps understand and solve problems. Recall, the command plot(expression, domain, option) produces a graph of the function defined by the expression over your choice of domain. Example 2.3 Determine whether the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{1}{1- \\cos x}\\) exists. Solution. Apply the plot function to the expression over the domain \\((-0.5, 0.5)\\). plot(1/(1-cos(x)), x=-0.5..0.5) The graph shows that the function \\(y=\\frac{1}{1- \\cos x}\\) goes to \\(\\infty\\) when \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\). So the limit is an infinite limit. Exercise 2.2 Estimate the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{t \\to 0}\\frac{1-\\cos x}{x}\\) numerically. Exercise 2.3 Determine whether the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to 1}\\frac{\\sin x}{|x-1|}\\) exists using the graph. 2.3 Evaluate limits Maple provides the following command to evaluate a limit limit(function, position, direction) The direction may be omitted when evaluating a two-side limit. Example 2.4 Determine whether the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{|x|}{x}\\) exists. Solution. You may find the left and right limits using the following commands. limit(abs(x)/x, x=0, left) limit(abs(x)/x, x=0, right) It turns out that \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\frac{|x|}{x}\\) does not exist because the left limit and the right limit are different. Example 2.5 Evaluate the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\), where \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x}\\). Solution. The limit can be obtained using the following command. limit((1/(x+h)-1/x)/h, x=0) Exercise 2.4 Determine whether the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 1/2}\\dfrac{2x-1}{|2x^3-x^2|}\\) exists. Exercise 2.5 Evaluate the limit \\(\\lim\\limits_{t\\to 0}\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+t}-\\sqrt{x}}{t}\\). 2.4 Learn limit laws using LimitTutor Suppose the limits of two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) at the same point \\(x=a\\) exist (equal finite numbers). Then the limit operation commutes with addition/subtraction, multiplication/division and power. In Maple, you may use the command LimitTutor(function, position, direction), which is again supported by the subpackage Student[Calculus1], to learn how to evaluate a limit using limit laws and theorems. Example 2.6 Evaluate \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\dfrac{1-\\cos x}{x}\\). Solution. Load the subpackage Student[Calculus1] if it was not loaded. with(Student[Calculus1]) Use the following command to learn how to evaluate the limit. LimitTutor(2-x^3, x=2,&#39;right&#39;) You will see an interactive windows pop out. You can choose the see the procedure step-by-step. Exercise 2.6 Evaluate \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0}\\dfrac{(x+2)(\\cos x-1)}{x^2-x}\\) using LimitTutor. 2.5 Squeeze Theorem Comparison is a very useful tool in problem solving. Squeeze theorem is such an example Theorem 2.1 (Squeeze Theorem) Suppose that \\[ f(x)\\leq g(x)\\leq h(x) \\] and \\[ \\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}f(x)=L=\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}h(x). \\] Then \\[ \\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}g(x)=L. \\] Let’s use Maple to understand the statement. Example 2.7 Graph the functions \\(f(x)=-x\\), \\(g(x)=x\\cos\\frac1x\\) and \\(h(x)=x\\) in the same coordinate system. What’s the limit of \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\). Solution. We use the plot() command to graph the functions together. plot([-x, x*cos(1/x), x], x=-1..1, discont, color=[red, blue, red]) Squeeze Theorem demonstration From the graph, we see that the \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}f(x)=0\\) as it is squeezed by two limits which are both \\(0\\). Exercise 2.7 Graph the functions \\(f(x)=-x\\), \\(g(x)=x\\sin\\frac1x\\) and \\(h(x)=x\\) in the same coordinate system. What’s the limit of \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(0\\). 2.6 Continuity A function \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if \\(f(a)\\) is defined and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}f(x)=f(a)\\). Intuitively, a function is continuous if the graph has no hole or jump. Example 2.8 Use graph to determine if the function \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} x &amp; x\\le -1 \\\\ 1/(x-1) &amp; -1&lt;x&lt;1\\\\ 3-x &amp; 1&lt;x\\le 2\\\\ \\sin(x - 2) + 1 &amp; x&gt;2\\\\ -2 &amp; x=2 \\end{cases} \\] is continuous over \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\). Find the discontinuities and verify them using the definition and properties of continuity. Solution. First we define the function. f := x -&gt; piecewise(x &lt;= -1, x, -1 &lt; x and x &lt; 1, 1/(x - 1), 1 &lt;= x and x &lt; 2, 3 - x, 2 &lt; x, sin(x - 2) + 1, -2) We first check visually whether the graph has holes or jumps. plot(f(x), discont=[showremovable], x=-5..5, smartview=true) In the above command, the option discont = [showremovable] is used to show removable discontinuities. An example shows three types of discontinuities From the graph, we can tell that the function has discontinuities which can also be found using Maple. discont(f(x), x) Maple gives three discontinuities \\(\\{-1, 1, 2\\}\\). Let’s first find limits at all three values. discontset:=[-1, 1, 2] for a in discontset do limit(f(x), x=a) end do You will find that limits do not exist at \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). The limit at \\(2\\) is \\(1\\). However, \\(g(2)=-2\\). So \\(f\\) has three discontinuities at \\(x=-1\\), \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=2\\). Exercise 2.8 Determine if the function \\[ f(x)= \\begin{cases} -x^2+2 &amp; x\\le 1 \\\\ \\tan x&amp; 1&lt;x&lt;\\pi/2\\\\ 2\\cos x-1 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] is continuous over \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\). Find all discontinuities if they exist and verify them using the definition. 2.7 Continuity and Limit of a Composite Function Continuous functions behave under composition. The composition of continuous functions is still continuous over its domain. More generally, Theorem 2.2 Let \\(f\\) be a function continuous at \\(x=L\\). Suppose that \\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}g(x)=L\\). Then \\[ \\lim{x\\to c}f(g(x))=f(L). \\] In general, the limit does not commute with composition. Example 2.9 Let \\[ f(x)=x^3\\quad \\text{and}\\quad g(x)= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; x=0\\\\ 2x-1 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\] Verify that \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0}f(g(x))=f(\\lim_{x\\to 0}g(x)). \\] Is is true that \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0}g(f(x))=g(\\lim_{x\\to 0}f(x))? \\] Solution. We first define \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in Maple f:=x-&gt;x^2 g:=x-&gt;piecewise(x=0, 0, x+2) Evaluate limits for \\(f\\circ g\\). limit(f(g(x)), x=0) f(limit(g(x), x=0)) The results verify that the limit commutes with composition if the outside function is continuous. Evaluate limits for \\(g\\circ f\\) limit(f(g(x)), x=0) f(limit(g(x), x=0)) The results show that the limit may not commute with composition if the outside function is not continuous. Exercise 2.9 Find three functions \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\) and a value \\(c\\) such that \\(f(g(x))\\) is continuous, \\[ \\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}f(h(x))=f(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}h(x)) \\] and \\[ \\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}h(g(x))\\neq h(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to c}g(x)). \\] 2.8 Intermediate Value Theorem A very important result about continuity is the intermediate value theorem (IVT for short). Theorem 2.3 (Intermediate Value Theorem) Let \\(f\\) be a function continuous over the interval \\([a, b]\\). Suppose that \\(f(a)\\neq f(b)\\) and \\(N\\) is a number between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\). Then there exists a number \\(c\\in (a, b)\\) such that \\(f(c)=N\\). In particular, if \\(f(a)f(b)&lt;0\\) then there exists a number \\(c\\) such that \\(f(c)=0\\). Example 2.10 Determine whether the equation \\[ \\sin^2x+2x-1=0 \\] has the solution in \\((-1, 1)\\). Estimate the solution if it exists. Solution. We first use the left hand side of the equation to define a function \\(eql\\). eql:=x-&gt;sin(x)^2 + 2*x - 1 Now lets verify that \\(eql\\) is continuous over \\([-1,1]\\) using the command iscont(). iscont(eql(x), x=-1..1) The result is True. We may apply the IVT. Let’s check if the value \\(eql(-1)\\cdot eql(1)&lt;0\\). evalf(eql(-1)*eql(1)) Here evalf() convert the symbolic answer to the (approximate) numerical value. Since the product is negative, applying the IVT, we know there exists a solution between \\((-1, 1)\\). This can also be seen from the graph using the command. plot(eql(x), x=-1..1) To estimate the solution, you may use the Maple command evalf(solve(eql(x) = 0, x)) or you may repeatedly apply IVT to find an approximate solution. m:=10; a:=-1; b:=1; for n from 1 to m do c[n] := (a + b)/2; if evalf(eql(c[n])*eql(a)) &lt; 0 then b := c[n]; else a := c[n]; end if; evalf(eql(c[n])); end do; Exercise 2.10 Find an integer \\(k\\) such that the equation \\[ \\cos^2x + 3x - 2=0 \\] has a solution in \\((k, k+1)\\). Estimate the solution. "],
["derivatives.html", "Topic 3 Derivatives 3.1 Derivative Functions 3.2 Calculating Derivatives 3.3 Chain Rule 3.4 Implicit Differentiation 3.5 Related Rates 3.6 Linearizations", " Topic 3 Derivatives 3.1 Derivative Functions What makes derivative so important in modern mathematics is the ideal of linearly approximating curves using tangent lines. Geometrically, the derivative of a function \\(f\\) at a point \\(x=a\\) is the slope of the line tangent to \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\). Using limits (if it exists), the derivative is defined as \\[ f&#39;(a):=\\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}. \\] Consider \\(a\\) as a variable, we may define a function called the derivative function. In terms of limits, the derivative function of a function \\(f\\), denoted by \\(f&#39;\\) is given by \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}. \\] Using limit laws, we can show that differentiable functions are continuous. Geometrically, the graph of differentiable function locally is flat without any hole or jump. All elementary functions are differentiable over their domain. But there are also many functions which are not differential everywhere in their domain. Example 3.1 Use the graph of the function \\(f(x)=|x-1|\\) to identify a \\(x\\) value where \\(f\\) is not differential. Verify your finding using the definition of differentiability. Solution. First plot the function. f:= x-&gt; abs(x) plot(f(x), x=-2..2) You will see the function is not flat near \\(x=1\\). To verify that, we calculate the limit of the difference quotient for all \\(x\\) and then evaluate the resulting function at \\(x=1\\). diffquot:=(f(x+h)-f(x))/h derlimit:= limit(diffquot, h=0) evalf(subs(x=1, derlimit)) Exercise 3.1 Determine whether the function \\[ f(x)=\\begin{cases} x\\sin\\left(\\frac1x\\right) &amp; x\\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; x=0 \\end{cases} \\] is differential at \\(x=0\\) using the definition of the differentiability. Exercise 3.2 Determine whether the function \\[ f(x)=\\begin{cases} x^2\\cos\\left(\\frac1x\\right) &amp; x\\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; x=0 \\end{cases} \\] is differential at \\(x=0\\) using the definition of the differentiability. Exercise 3.3 Using the definition to find the derivative for \\(y=\\sin x\\). 3.2 Calculating Derivatives Calculating a derivative in Maple is as easy as calculating a limit. The command for differentiation is diff(function, variable). For higher derivatives, you may simply repeat the variable or use [variable$n] to indicate the \\(n\\) times differentiation. Example 3.2 Calculate the first derivative and the second derivative for the function \\[ f(x)=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\sin^2 x + 1}}. \\] Solution. First represent the function rule simply by f. f:=2/(sqrt(2*(sin(x))^2+1)) Calculate the first derivative and denote the derivative by f1. f1:=diff(f, x); Calculate the second derivative and denote the derivative by f2. You may use one of the following three commands. f2:=diff(f1, x) f2:=diff(f, x, x) f2:=diff(f, [x$2]) Maple also has a tutoring command for differentiation: DiffTutor(function, variable) which is again supported by the subpackage Student[Calculus1]. However, DiffTutor only works for the first derivative. Example 3.3 Calculate the derivative for \\(g(x)=\\frac{x^2-2x-x^{-3}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) by hand and compare your calculation the the result given by DiffTutor. Solution. By hand, we may simplify the expression using rational exponents first and then apply derivative rules. \\[ g&#39;(x)=(x^{\\frac32}-2x^{\\frac12}-x^{-\\frac72})&#39;=\\frac32\\sqrt{x}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}+\\frac{7}{2x^4\\sqrt{x}}=\\frac{3x^5-2x^4+7}{2x^4\\sqrt{x}}. \\] To see the result from DiffTutor, we use the following command. Remember to load the Student[Calculus1] first. with(Student[Calculus1]) DiffTutor((x^2-2*x-x^(-3))/sqrt(x), x) Here is how does the output look like The derivative of a function obtained by the DiffTutor command Exercise 3.4 Calculate the first derivative for the function \\(y=2x^{-1}-3\\sqrt{x}\\) by hand and by Maple. Compare two results. Are they different? If so, can you explain the difference? Exercise 3.5 Calculate the first derivative for the function \\(y=x\\sin^{-1}(x)\\) by hand and by Maple. Compare two results. Are they different? If so, can you explain the difference? Exercise 3.6 Calculate the first derivative for the function \\(y=\\frac{\\cos(x)+\\sin x}{x}\\) by hand and by Maple. Compare two results. Are they different? If so, can you explain the difference? Exercise 3.7 Calculate the \\(3\\)-th derivative for the function \\(y=\\sin x\\cos x\\) by hand and by Maple. Can you find a formula for the \\(n\\)-th derivative of the function? 3.3 Chain Rule Let \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) be two differentiable functions. Then the derivative of the composite function \\(f(g(x))\\) can be calculated using the following formula \\[ (f(g(x)))&#39;=f&#39;(g(x))g&#39;(x). \\] Why there is an extra factor \\(g&#39;(x)\\)? This is mainly because \\(g(x+h)\\approx g(x)+g&#39;(x)h\\). Now let’s use Maple to understand the chain rule. In Maple, the symbol for composition is @, that is, in Maple the composition \\(f\\circ g\\) is given by f@g. Since we will evaluate derivative functions, in addition to the command diff(expression, variable), we will also use D(function)(variable) to find the derivative function. One major difference between those two commands is that D is designed to differentiate functions, whereas diff is for differentiating expressions. A screen shot from Maple shows a comparison between the commands D and diff Example 3.4 Let \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\), \\(g(x)=2x\\) and \\(F(x)=2\\sin x\\cos x\\). Find \\(f&#39;(g(x))\\), \\((fg)&#39;(x)\\), \\((f\\circ g)&#39;(x)\\) and \\(F&#39;(x)\\)? Compare the derivatives and draw a conclusion. Solution. We first define the functions. f:=x-&gt;sin(x); g:=x-&gt;2*x; F:=x-&gt;2*sin(x)*cos(x); Find the derivative functions Der_f_g:=D(f)(g(x)); # f&#39;(g(x)) Der_fg:=diff(f(x)g(x), x); # (fg)&#39;(x) Der_fog:=D(f@g)(x); # (fog)&#39;(x) Der_F:=D(F)(x); # F&#39;(x) To compare the derivatives, we use the command expand and simplify to rewrite the expressions. simplify(expand(Der_f_g)); simplify(expand(Der_fg)); simplify(expand(Der_fog)); simplify(expand(Der_F)); From the outputs, we see that \\((f\\circ g)&#39;(x)=F&#39;(x)\\). Why they are the same? This is because \\(\\sin(2x)=2\\sin x\\cos x\\)!. An example about the chain rule solved using Maple Remark. You may also use D(unapply(f(x)*g(x), x))(x) to calculate the derivative of the product function \\((fg)(x)=f(x)g(x)\\). The chain rule is almost unavoidable in calculation of derivatives. Sometimes, using chain rule will simplify the calculation. Example 3.5 Consider the function \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sin x+\\cos x}\\). Find the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\) using DiffTutor. Which rule of derivative was applied first? Find the point where the tangent line of \\(f\\) is horizontal over the domain \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). Find an equation of the tangent line at \\((0, 1)\\). Plot the tangent line and the function together over the domain \\((-\\frac12, \\frac12)\\). Solution. You may use quotient rule to find the derivative. However, the chain rule may be a better choice because \\(\\frac{1}{\\sin x+\\cos x}=(\\sin x+\\cos x)^{-1}\\). Let’s try DiffTutor. restart; # Use `restart` to clear the internal memory. with(Student[Calculus1]); f:=1/(sin(x)+cos(x)); DiffTutor(f, x); You see that the chain rule was applied first. A example that chain rule was applied first by DiffTutor To find the points where the tangent line is horizontal, we need to solve the equation \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\). solve(diff(f, x)=0) To find the tangent line, we find the derivative \\(f&#39;(0)\\). One way is to use unapply. unapply(diff(f, x), x)(0) You may also use eval(expression, variable=value). eval(diff(f, x), x=0) Since \\(f&#39;(0)=-1\\), the tangent line at \\((0, 1)\\) is defined by \\(y=-x+1\\). y:= -x+1 Now let’s verify visually that \\(y=-x+1\\) is the tangent line. plot([f, y], x=-1/2..1/2) Exercise 3.8 Let \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\), \\(g(x)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x\\) and \\(h(x)=\\cos x\\). Find \\(f&#39;(g(x))\\), \\((fg)&#39;(x)\\), \\((f\\circ g)&#39;(x)\\) and \\(h&#39;(x)\\). Compare the derivatives and draw a conclusion. Exercise 3.9 Let \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and \\(g(x)=\\cos x\\) and \\(h(x)=\\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(2x)+1)\\). Find \\(f&#39;(g(x))\\), \\((fg)&#39;(x)\\), \\((f\\circ g)&#39;(x)\\) and \\(h&#39;(x)\\). Compare the derivatives and draw a conclusion. Exercise 3.10 Consider the function \\(F(x)=\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi(x^2+1)}{3})\\). Define three functions \\(f\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) so that \\(F(x)=f(g(h(x)))\\). Describe how the derivative function \\(F&#39;(x)\\) was calculated by DiffTutor. Find the point where the tangent line of \\(F\\) is horizontal over the domain \\((0, 1)\\). Find an equation of the tangent line of \\(F\\) at \\((1, \\frac34)\\). Plot the tangent line and the function together over the domain \\((\\frac12, \\frac32)\\). 3.4 Implicit Differentiation Implicit differentiation is an application of the chain rule. It provides a way to find the slope of a tangent line of a function implicitly defined by an equation, that is, the dependent variable is not isolated. In Maple, there are two useful commands that help us understand implicit defined functions. The command implicitplot(equation, domain, range, options) supported by the package plots can be used to graph an implicitly defined function. The command implicitdiff(function, dependent variable, independent variable) can be used to find derivatives implicitly. Example 3.6 Graph the function \\(y\\) of \\(x\\) defined by \\(x^2+2y^2=2x+4y\\) with it tangent line at \\((2, 0)\\) over the domain \\((1, 3)\\) and range \\((-1, 2)\\). Solution. Let’s first assign an name to the equation. (Run restart first if x and y were previously used an names.) restart; eqnf:=x^2+2*y^2=2*x+4*y; Now let’s find the derivative function, and its value at \\((0, 1)\\). D_eqnf:=implicitdiff(eqnf, y, x); slope:=eval(D_eqnf, {x=2, y=0}); Let’s define the tangent line tangentline:= y=slope*(x-2)+0 Now we are ready to plot the function with the tangent line together. with(plots); implicitplot([eqnf, tangentline], x=1..3, y=-1..2, color=[red, blue]); Remark. Another way, which is more flexible, to put two or more graphs together is to use the command display(graph1, graph2) which is supported by the package plots. For example, the following commands will show two curves in a single picture. with(plots): g1 := implicitplot(x^2+y^2=1, x=-1..1, y=0..1): g2 := plot(1-abs(x), x=-1..1): display(g1, g2, title=&quot;Two Together&quot;); Note that we use colone : at the end of a command to hide the output. Exercise 3.11 For the ellipse \\(x^2-xy+y^2=4\\), find the locations of all horizontal tangent lines and plot them implicitly on the same graph as the relation over the interval \\(-3 \\leq x \\leq 3\\) and \\(-3 \\leq y \\leq 3\\). Exercise 3.12 Find an equation of the line tangent to the curve \\(x^2 + (x-y)^3 = 9\\) at \\(x=1\\). (You may want to use solve and subs to find the \\(y\\) when \\(x=1\\)). Exercise 3.13 Find all points \\((x, y)\\) on the curve of \\(|x|^{2/3} + |y|^{2/3} = 8\\) where lines tangent to the curve at \\((x, y)\\) is perpendicular to the line \\(x-y=1\\). (Use ?solve to learn how to solve a system of equations in Maple). 3.5 Related Rates Stewart suggests the following general steps for solving problems about related rates. Read the problem carefully. (What quantities are known? What is the unknown rate of change?) Draw a diagram if possible. Introduce notations. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time. Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives. Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary, use the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to the shared independent variable, say \\(t\\). Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the unknown rate. In Maple, the quantities that shared by the same independent variable should be written in function notations. See the following example for details. Example 3.7 A spherical shaped balloon is inflated at a constant rate 2 cm\\(^3\\)/s. Find the relative rate growth of the diameter when its 10 cm wide. Solution. The volume of a sphere is given by \\(V=\\frac{4\\pi}{3}r^3\\). In this equation, both \\(V\\) and \\(r\\) are functions of the time \\(t\\). In Maple, we will use V(t) and r(t) for the volume and the radius. eqn_v:=V(t)=4*Pi/3*(r(t))^3 We know that at a certain time \\(r(t)=10/2=5\\), and \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}V(t)|_{r(t)=5}=2\\). What is asked is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}r(t)|_{r(t)=5}\\). The two rates are related by the equation obtained by differentiating both side of the equation eqn_v. D_eqn_v:=diff(eqn_v, t) In the above equation, we need to solve the derivative of \\(r\\) with respect to \\(t\\). Let’s first simplify notations. D_v:=diff(V(t), t); D_r:=diff(r(t), t); D_r:=solve(D_eqn_v, D_r); Now we plugin D_v=2 and r(t)=5 to find the value for D_r. subs({D_v=2, r(t)=5}, D_r) # or using eval(D_r, {D_v=2, r(t)=5}) Exercise 3.14 A cylindrical cup with radius 5 cm is being filled with coffee at a rate of 2 cm\\(^3\\)/s. How fast is the height of the coffee increasing? Exercise 3.15 Two cars start moving from the same point. One travels north at 30 mph and the other travels west at 50 mph. At what rate is the distance between the cars changing one hour later? Exercise 3.16 Sands dumping from a truck to the ground at a constant rate 5 m\\(^3\\)/s is creating a circular cone. Find a relation between the rate of growth of the radius of the base and the rate of growth of the height of cone, when the the base is 6 m and the heigh is 4 m. 3.6 Linearizations Let \\(f\\) be the function differentiable at \\(x = a\\). The linearization of \\(f\\) at \\(x = a\\) is defined to be the function \\(L(x)=f&#39;(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\). For any value \\(b\\) near \\(a\\), the function value \\(f(b)\\) is approximately the same as \\(L(b)\\). This method is called linear approximation. The tangent line approximation is fundamental to almost every application of the derivative. Example 3.8 Find the linearization \\(L(x)\\) of the function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[3](x+7)\\) at \\(x=1\\) and use this linearization to estimate \\(f(0.99)\\). How large is the error? Solution. We first find the slope fr the linearization which is the derivative \\(f&#39;(1)\\). f:=x-&gt;surd(x+7, 3); # or f:=x-&gt;(x+7)^(1/3) m:=simplify(D(f)(1)); # this is the slope (simplified). Now we define the linearization \\(L(x)\\) and estimate \\(f(0.99)\\) using \\(L(0.99)\\). L:=x-&gt;m*(x-1)+f(1); L(0.99); The error may be calculated based on the output of the follow command. f_L:=f(0.99)-L(0.99); The results shows that the linear approximation is slightly over estimated with an error less than \\(4\\times 10^{-7}\\). Exercise 3.17 Find the linear approximation \\(L(x)\\) of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x+1}\\) at \\(x = 1\\). Use this linearization to approximate \\(f(1.02)\\). Exercise 3.18 Find the linear approximation \\(L(x)\\) of the function \\(f(x) = \\cos(2x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\). Use this linearization to approximate \\(f(0.1)\\). Exercise 3.19 Find the linear approximation \\(L(x)\\) of the function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2+5}\\) at \\(x = 2\\). Use this linearization to approximate \\(f(2.03)\\). "],

In practice, it’s better to recognize the shape of a cross section, find the volume of a slice of the solid and then set up the integral. In the following, you will see some tools/commands from Maple which are very helpful to calculate the volume of a solid. In Maple, the following command, supported by the package Student[Calculus1], can be used to get the graph, the integral and the volume of the solid obtained by rotation the region bounded by \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(x)\\), \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\).

You will see clearly that the graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric with respect to the line \\(y=x\\). Example 8.1 Graph the function \\(f(x)=x^3-2\\), its inverse function, and the line \\(y=x\\) over the interval \\([-2,2]\\). Find the inverse function. Solution. One way to plot the function and its inverse together is to use the following command which is supported by the package Student[Calculus1]. InversePlot(x^3-3, x = -2 .. 2) Here is the output in Maple Graph of a pair of functions inverse to each other Another way to plot the function \\(f\\) and its inverse \\(g\\) together uses the plot function. plot([f(x), g(x), x], x = -2 .. 4, y = -5 .. 5, color = [red, black, blue]) To find the inverse function, we replace \\(f(x)\\) by \\(y\\), then switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and solve for \\(y\\). In Maple, you may use the command solve(equation/inequality, variable) to solve an equation or an inequality (even system of equations/inequalities).

Note I have switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). solve(x=y^3, y) To find the derivative of the inverse function of a function \\(f\\) at a given point \\(x=a\\), we may apply the formula \\[(f^{-1})&#39;(a)=\\dfrac{1}{f&#39;(f^{-1}(a))}.\\] In Maple, we may use the following commands to calculate the value of the derivative function.

The natural exponential function \\(y=e^x\\) is defined as the inverse function of \\(y=\\ln(x)\\). From the definition, we have very important identities \\[ \\ln(e^x)=x\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad e^{\\ln x}=x. \\] Using those two identities, we may define general exponential functions and general logarithmic function, and deduce the Law of Logarithms and Law of Exponents. For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we have \\(b^x=(e^{\\ln b})^x=e^{x\\ln b}\\). For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we define \\(y=\\log_bx\\) to be the inverse function of \\(y=b^x\\) By solving \\(x=b^y\\) for \\(y\\), we find that \\(\\log_bx=\\dfrac{\\ln x}{\\ln b}\\). This identity is called the change of base property. How do graphs of logarithmic functions and exponential functions look like? Example 8.3 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\ln x, \\qquad y=e^x, \\qquad y=2^x, \\qquad y=\\log_2x, y=x. \\] Solution. In Maple, the logarithm \\(\\log_bx\\) is given by log[b](x). When \\(b=e\\), you simply use ln(x) for \\(\\ln x\\). When \\(b=10\\), you may also use log(x) or log10(x) for \\(\\log_{10}x\\). The exponent \\(b^x\\) is given by b^x in Maple. When \\(b=e\\), you may also use exp(x) to represent \\(e^x\\). To graph the functions together with different colors, we use the following command plot([ln(x), exp(x), 2^x, log[2](x), x], x=-5..5, color=[blue, green, purple, yellow, red]) Here is the output Graph of some logarithmic and exponential functions Exercise 8.2 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\log_3x, \\qquad y=3^x, \\qquad y=(1/3)^x, \\qquad y=\\log_{1/3}x. \\] Find the pairs that are symmetric to each other with respect to a certain line.

Describe how \\(y\\)-values change when bases changes from small number to bigger number? 8.2.2 Differentiation and integration of logarithmic and exponential functions In Maple, one way to do differentiation and integration is to use the Calculus Palette on the left side. Calculus Palette in Maple The other way is to use the commands diff(f(x), x) , int(f(x), x), and int(f(x), x=a..b). Supported by the Student[Calculus1] package, Maple also provides the tutor commands DiffTutor() and IntTutor() which can show step-by-step solution of differentiation and integration. Note you may also access tutor commands from the Start page (click the home button in the toolbar and look for Calculus). Example 8.4 Find \\(y&#39;\\), where \\(y=\\ln \\left(x^{3}+5x+1\\right)\\). Solution. Using diff: diff(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x) We get \\[ y&#39;=\\dfrac{3x^{2}+5}{x^{3}+5 x+1}. \\] Type in (assume that with(Student[Calculus1]) was run) DiffTutor(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x) and hit enter you will see By click Next Step or All Steps you will see detailed solution with rules used.

Without the ics, dsolve will provide a general solution. Example 8.6 Find the function \\(f(x)\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\(f&#39;(x)=k f(x)\\) with \\(f(0)=5\\) and \\(f(2)=3\\). Solution. Use the following command dsolve({f(0)=5, f&#39;(x)=k f(x)}) we get \\(f(x)=5e^{kx}\\). To find \\(k\\), we solve the equation \\(3=5e^{2k}\\) by solve(3=5*e^(2*k), k) which shows that \\(k=\\frac{\\ln3-\\ln5}{2}\\approx -0.255\\). Here we use evalf(%) (% represents the previous result) to get the approximation. So the function \\(f\\) is given by \\[ f(x)=5e^{\\frac{x(\\ln3-\\ln5)}{2}}\\approx 5e^{-0.255x}. \\] Exercise 8.9 Find the function \\(y\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\(y&#39;(x)=k y(x)\\) with \\(y(0)=2\\) and \\(y(5)=11\\). 8.4 Inverse Trigonometric Functions 8.4.1 Domains and Ranges To define the inverse function, the original function must be a one-to-one function. For a trigonometric function, we have to restrict the function over a specific domain to ensure that the function is one-to-one. For simplicity, we pick domains near the origin for trigonometric functions. To be more precise, we consider the following trigonometric functions: \\[ y=\\sin x,\\quad -\\pi/2\\leq x\\leq \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq y\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\cos x,\\quad 0\\leq x\\leq \\pi ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq y\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\tan x,\\quad -\\pi/2&lt; x&lt; \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -\\infty&lt;y&lt;\\infty. \\] Their inverse functions are \\[ y=\\arcsin x,\\quad -\\pi/2\\leq y\\leq \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq x\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\arccos x,\\quad 0\\leq y\\leq \\pi ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq x\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\arctan x,\\quad -\\pi/2&lt; y&lt; \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -\\infty&lt; x&lt;\\infty. \\] To see the graphs of the functions, we may use the plot(f(x), x = a..b, opts) command. Or, to graph \\(f\\), \\(f^{-1}\\) and \\(y=x\\) together, we may also use the command InversePlot(f(x), x = a..b, opts) supported by the package Student[Calculus1]. Example 8.7 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\tan x, \\qquad y=\\arctan x, \\qquad y=x. \\] Solution. #load the package ``Student[Calculus1]&quot;. with(Student[Calculus1]) #plot the functions InversePlot(tan(x),x=-Pi/2..Pi/2) Here is the output Graph of the tangent and arctangent functions Exercise 8.10 Graph the following functions together over an appropriate domain. \\[ y=\\cot x, \\qquad y=\\mathrm{arccot} x, \\qquad y=x. \\] What’s the domain and range of \\(y=\\mathrm{arccot} x\\)? 8.4.2 Differentiation and integration of inverse trigonometric functions In the section {#Differentiation and integration of logarithmic and exponential functions}, we learned to how use Maple to learn differentiation and integration. Now let find derivatives and integrals of some inverse trigonometric functions. Example 8.8 Find \\(y&#39;\\), where \\(y=\\mathrm{arccot} x\\). Solution. Surely, we may use diff or DiffTutor to find the derivative. Here let’s me introduce to you another command implicitdiff. We’ve learned that (see {#Inverse Functions}) to find the inverse function, we switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and then solve for \\(y\\). When finding the derivative, we don’t have to solve for \\(y\\) instead, we want \\(y&#39;\\) which is implicitly defined by an equation. In this case, we have \\(x=\\mathrm{arccot}y\\). Enter the following commands in Maple, you will find \\(y&#39;=-\\frac{1}{x^2+1}\\). implicitdiff(x=cot(y), y, x) subs(cot(y) = x, %) where % is a ditto operator that allows you to refer to a previously computed result in Maple. Exercise 8.11 Find the derivative of \\(y=\\mathrm{arcsec} x\\) Exercise 8.12 Find the derivative of \\(y=\\mathrm{arccsc} x\\) For integrals of inverse trigonometric function, you may need the method of integration by parts.

["infinite-sequences-and-series.html", "Topic 11 Infinite Sequences and Series 11.1 Introduction to Sequences and Series 11.2 Power Series 11.3 Taylor Expansion", " Topic 11 Infinite Sequences and Series 11.1 Introduction to Sequences and Series A sequence is a list of numbers in a definite order (indexed by integers). A series may be considered as the limit of the sequence of partial sums. When the sequence is explicitly defined by an mathematical expression \\(a_n=f(n)\\), Maple has the following command to list numbers of the sequence seq(f, i=m..n, step). Example 11.1 Find the first 10 terms of the sequence \\(\\{\\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\\}_{n=1}^\\infty\\). Determine whether the sequence \\(\\{\\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\\}\\) is convergent or divergent. Solution. # using seq seq(1/(n*(n+1)), n=1..10) The sequence converges to \\(0\\). For a series \\(\\sum a_n\\), normally it is not easy to find explicit expression for the partial sum \\(s_n=\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^n a_k\\). However, if sequence is defined by an mathematical expression \\(a_n=f(n)\\), we may find values of partial sums recursively use a for/from loop statement in Maple: for *counter* from *initial* by *increment* to *final* do statement_sequence; end do; Example 11.2 Find the first 20 partial sums \\(s_k=\\sum_{n=1}^{n}a_n\\) of the infinite series \\[ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1{2^n}=1+\\frac12+\\frac14+\\frac18+\\cdots. \\] Determine whether the series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1{2^n}\\) is convergent or divergent. Solution. # Set up s when n=0 s:=1 # Find 10 terms using `for/from loop` for n from 1 to 10 do s:=s+1/(2^n); end do; The series converges to 2. Of course, we may also use for/from loop to list numbers of a sequence. Solution. Second solution to example 11.1. # using `for/from loop` for n from 1 to 10 do 1/(n*(n+1); end do; When the sequence is defined by a recurrence formula like the Fibonacci sequence, we will need to Maple how to interpret the formula. For that purpose, we use a procedure, which encloses a sequence of statements between proc(...) and end proc, to define the formula in Maple. For example, the following is a procedure that defines a function \\(a(x)=\\sqrt{x}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\): a:=proc(x) sqrt(x)-1/sqrt{x}; end proc; To structure codes in a procedure, you may use Code Edit Region which can be find in the Insert menu. To execute codes within this region, click Execute Code from the Edit menu, or use the shortcut command Ctrl+E. Example 11.3 The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \\(fib(0)=0\\), \\(fib(1)=1\\) and \\(fib(n)=fib(n-1)+fic(n-2)\\). Find the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Solution. We first define a function \\(fib(n)\\) which returns the \\(n\\)-th Fibonacci number. fib := proc (n::nonnegint) if 2 &lt;= n then return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2): else return n: end if; end proc Now we can use either seq() or for/from loop. seq(fib(n), n=0..19) Exercise 11.1 Find the first 20 terms of the sequence \\[ \\{\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\}_{n=1}^\\infty. \\] Determine whether the sequence \\(\\{\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{n}}\\}\\) is convergent or divergent. Exercise 11.2 Find the first 20 partial sums \\(s_k=\\sum_{n=1}^{n}a_n\\) of the infinite series \\[\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1n=1+\\frac12+\\frac13+\\frac14+\\cdots. \\] Determine whether the series \\(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac1n\\) is convergent or divergent. Exercise 11.3 Find the 20th to 30th Fibonacci numbers. 11.2 Power Series A power series is a series with a variable \\(x\\): \\[ \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_nx^n=c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+c_3x^3+\\cdots. \\] More generally, a series of the form \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n(x-a)^n=c_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+c_3(x-a)^3+\\cdots \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] is called a power series at \\(a\\). We call a positive number \\(R\\) the radius of convergence of the power series (eq:Taylor-series) if the power series converges whenever \\(\\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R\\) and diverges whenever \\(\\left|x-a\\right|&gt;R\\). If a function \\(f\\) has a power series representation, i.e. \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(x-a)^n,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R, \\] then its coefficients are given by \\(c_n=\\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}.\\) Example 11.4 Find the interval of convergence of the power series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-2)^nx^n}{n^3}. \\] Solution. # Find the abs(a_{n+1}/a_n) q:=abs((-2)^(n+1)(n+1)^3/(-2)^(n+1)(n+1)^3); # Find the limit of q r:=limit(simplify(q), n=infinity) # Find the interval of convergence solve(abs(x)&lt;1/r, x) Example 11.5 Find the Taylor expansion of the function \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x-2}\\) at \\(x=0\\) up to the 5-th order. Plot \\(f(x)\\) and the \\(5\\)-th order Taylor polynomial together. Solution. # Find the Taylor expansion. ftaylor:=taylor(1/(x-2), x = 0, 5) # convert the Taylor series into a polynomial fpoly:=convert(ftaylor, polynom) # Plot the functions plot([1/(x-2), fpoly], x=-1..1) Exercise 11.4 Find the interval of convergence of the power series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-4)^nx^n}{\\sqrt{n}}. \\] Exercise 11.5 Find the Taylor expansion of the function \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) at \\(x=0\\) up to the 5-th order. Plot \\(f(x)\\) and the \\(5\\)-th order Taylor polynomial together over the interval \\([-\\pi,\\pi]\\). 11.3 Taylor Expansion Let \\(f(x)\\) be a function. Assume that the \\(k\\)-th order derivatives \\(f^k(a)\\) exist for \\(k=1, 2, \\dots, n\\). The polynomial \\[ T_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k \\] is called the \\(n\\)-th degree Taylor polynomial of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\). Let \\(f(x)\\) be a function has derivative at \\(a\\) up to all orders. Set \\[ R_n(x)=\\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R, \\] which is called the reminder of the Taylor series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k. \\] If \\[ \\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} R_n(x)=0 \\] for \\(\\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R\\), then \\(f(x)\\) is the sum of the Taylor series on the interval, that is \\[ f(x)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R. \\] If \\(\\left|f^{n+1}{x}\\right|\\leq M\\) for \\(\\left|x-a\\right|\\leq d\\), then the reminder \\(R_n\\) satisfies the follow inequality \\[ \\left|R_n(x)\\right|\\leq \\dfrac{M}{n+1}\\left|x-a\\right|^{n+1}\\quad \\text{for}\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|\\leq d. \\] Roughly speaking, the absolute value of the reminder \\(\\left|R_n(x)\\right|\\) determines how accurate the Taylor polynomial approximation. Example 11.6 Approximate function \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) by the degree 3 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=1\\). Solution. # Find the Taylor series. fTs:=taylor(sin(x), x = 0, 4) # Convert the Taylor series into a polynomial fTp:=convert(fTs, polynom) # Evaluate the Taylor polynomial at 1 subs(x=1, fpolyapprox) Example 11.7 Plot the function \\[ g(x)=\\begin{cases}e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} &amp; x\\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; x=0\\end{cases} \\] and its 5-th order Taylor polynomial over the domain \\([-2..2]\\). What can you conclude? Solution. # Define a piece-wisely defined function. g:=piecewise(x!=0, exp(-1/x^2), 0) # Find Taylor polynomial of degree 5. for n to 5 do T := (eval(diff(g(x), x$n), x = 0))*x^n/factorial(n)+T end do # Plot the functions plot([g,T],x=-2..2, color=[red, blue]) The graphs of the functions are shown in the picture. In the solution, x$n is a shortcut option for x, x, x, x, x in the diff command. Exercise 11.6 Approximate function \\(f(x)=e^x\\) by the degree 5 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=1\\). Exercise 11.7 Compare the function \\(y=\\sin x\\) with its degree 10 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=0\\). "]
