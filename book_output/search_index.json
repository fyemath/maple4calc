["volume-of-revolution.html", "Topic 1 Volume of Revolution", " Topic 1 Volume of Revolution In terms of definite integrals, the volume of a solid obtained by rotating a region about the \\(x\\)-axis can be calculated by \\[\\int_a^b \\pi (r_1(x)^2 - r_2(x)^2) \\mathrm{d} x \\qquad \\text{disk/washer method},\\] or \\[\\int_a^b 2\\pi r(y) h(y) \\mathrm{d} y \\qquad \\text{shell method method},\\] where \\(r_1(x)\\), \\(r_2(x)\\) and \\(r(x)\\) represents the radius and \\(h(x)\\) represents the height of a cylindrical shell. In practice, itâ€™s better to recognize the shape of a cross section, find the volume of a slice of the solid and then set up the integral. In the following, you will see some tools/commands from Maple which are very helpful to calculate the volume of a solid. In Maple, the following command, supported by the package Student[Calculus1], can be used to get the graph, the integral and the volume of the solid obtained by rotation the region bounded by \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(x)\\), \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). VolumeOfRevolution(f(x), g(x), x = a..b, opts) To learn what options does the command VolumeOfRevolution have, you may type ?VolumeOfRevolution in the Math mode and hit enter. You will see the help page. Example 1.1 Show the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^2\\) and \\(y=x\\) about \\(y\\)-axis. Set up an integral for the volume. Find the volume. Solution. #Load the package with(Student[Calculus1]) #Show the solid VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = plot) #Set up an integral VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = integral) #Find the volume VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = value) The outputs in Maple can be seen in the following picture Remark. 1. If you change the function to VolumeOfRevolutionTutor, you will see an interactive popup windows which does exactly the same thing. If the rotation axis is not an axis of the coordinate system, you need add the option distancefromaxis = numeric into the function. For example, if in the above example, the rotation is about \\(y=-2\\), then the Maple command should be the following VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, distancefromaxis = -2, output = integral) Exercise 1.1 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^3\\), \\(x=0\\), \\(y=1\\) about \\(y\\)-axis Exercise 1.2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^3\\), \\(y=0\\), \\(x=1\\) about (a) \\(y=0\\), and (b) \\(x=2\\).

["logarithmic-and-exponential-functions.html", "Topic 3 Logarithmic and Exponential Functions 3.1 Basic properties and graphs 3.2 Differentiation and integration of logarithmic and exponential functions", " Topic 3 Logarithmic and Exponential Functions 3.1 Basic properties and graphs The natural logarithmic function \\(y=\\ln(x)\\) is defined by \\(\\ln(x)=\\int_1^x\\frac{1}{t}\\mathrm{d} t\\). The natural exponential function \\(y=e^x\\) is defined as the inverse function of \\(y=\\ln(x)\\). From the definition, we have very important identities \\[ \\ln(e^x)=x\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad e^{\\ln x}=x. \\] Using those two identities, we may define general exponential functions and general logarithmic function, and deduce the Law of Logarithms and Law of Exponents. For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we have \\(b^x=(e^{\\ln b})^x=e^{x\\ln b}\\). For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we define \\(y=\\log_bx\\) to be the inverse function of \\(y=b^x\\) By solving \\(x=b^y\\) for \\(y\\), we find that \\(\\log_bx=\\dfrac{\\ln x}{\\ln b}\\). This identity is called the change of base property. How do graphs of logarithmic functions and exponential functions look like? Example 1.1 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\ln x, \\qquad y=e^x, \\qquad y=2^x, \\qquad y=\\log_2x, y=x. \\] Solution. In Maple, the logarithm \\(\\log_bx\\) is given by log[b](x). When \\(b=e\\), you simply use ln(x) for \\(\\ln x\\). When \\(b=10\\), you may also use log(x) or log10(x) for \\(\\log_{10}x\\). The exponent \\(b^x\\) is given by b^x in Maple. When \\(b=e\\), you may also use exp(x) to represent \\(e^x\\). To graph the functions together with different colors, we use the following command plot([ln(x), exp(x), 2^x, log[2](x), x], x=-5..5, color=[blue, green, purple, yellow, red]) Here is the output Graph of some logarithmic and exponential functions Exercise 3.1 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\log_3x, \\qquad y=3^x, \\qquad y=(1/3)^x, \\qquad y=\\log_{1/3}x. \\] Find the pairs that are symmetric to each other with respect to a certain line.

For a trigonometric function, we have to restrict the function over a specific domain to ensure that the function is one-to-one. For simplicity, we pick domains near the origin for trigonometric functions. To be more precise, we consider the following trigonometric functions: \\[ y=\\sin x,\\quad -\\pi/2\\leq x\\leq \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq y\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\cos x,\\quad 0\\leq x\\leq \\pi ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq y\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\tan x,\\quad -\\pi/2&lt; x&lt; \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -\\infty&lt;y&lt;\\infty. \\] Their inverse functions are \\[ y=\\arcsin x,\\quad -\\pi/2\\leq y\\leq \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq x\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\arccos x,\\quad 0\\leq y\\leq \\pi ~~\\text{and}~ -1\\leq x\\leq 1; \\] \\[ y=\\arctan x,\\quad -\\pi/2&lt; y&lt; \\pi/2 ~~\\text{and}~ -\\infty&lt; x&lt;\\infty. \\] To see the graphs of the functions, we may use the plot(f(x), x = a..b, opts) command.

Now let find derivatives and integrals of some inverse trigonometric functions. Example 5.1 Find \\(y&#39;\\), where \\(y=\\mathrm{arccot} x\\). Solution. Surely, we may use diff or DiffTutor to find the derivative. Here letâ€™s me introduce to you another command implicitdiff. Weâ€™ve learned that (see {#Inverse Functions}) to find the inverse function, we switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and then solve for \\(y\\). When finding the derivative, we donâ€™t have to solve for \\(y\\) instead, we want \\(y&#39;\\) which is implicitly defined by an equation. In this case, we have \\(x=\\mathrm{arccot}y\\). Enter the following commands in Maple, you will find \\(y&#39;=-\\frac{1}{x^2+1}\\). implicitdiff(x=cot(y), y, x) subs(cot(y) = x, %) where % is a ditto operator that allows you to refer to a previously computed result in Maple.

If a function \\(f\\) has a power series representation, i.e. \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n(x-a)^n,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R, \\] then its coefficients are given by \\(c_n=\\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}.\\) Example 1.1 Find the interval of convergence of the power series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-2)^nx^n}{n^3}. \\] Solution. # Find the abs(a_{n+1}/a_n) q:=abs((-2)^(n+1)(n+1)^3/(-2)^(n+1)(n+1)^3); # Find the limit of q r:=limit(simplify(q), n=infinity) # Find the interval of convergence solve(abs(x)&lt;1/r, x) Example 2.1 Find the Taylor expansion of the function \\(f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{x-2}\\) at \\(x=0\\) up to the 5-th order. Plot \\(f(x)\\) and the \\(5\\)-th order Taylor polynomial together. Solution. # Find the Taylor expansion. ftaylor:=taylor(1/(x-2), x = 0, 5) # convert the Taylor series into a polynomial fpoly:=convert(ftaylor, polynom) # Plot the functions plot([1/(x-2), fpoly], x=-1..1) Exercise 1.2 Find the interval of convergence of the power series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{(-4)^nx^n}{\\sqrt{n}}. \\] Exercise 5.1 Find the Taylor expansion of the function \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) at \\(x=0\\) up to the 5-th order. Plot \\(f(x)\\) and the \\(5\\)-th order Taylor polynomial together over the interval \\([-\\pi,\\pi]\\). "],
["taylor-expansion.html", "Topic 12 Taylor Expansion", " Topic 12 Taylor Expansion Let \\(f(x)\\) be a function. Assume that the \\(k\\)-th order derivatives \\(f^k(a)\\) exist for \\(k=1, 2, \\dots, n\\). The polynomial \\[ T_n(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^n\\dfrac{f^{(n)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k \\] is called the \\(n\\)-th degree Taylor polynomial of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\). Let \\(f(x)\\) be a function has derivative at \\(a\\) up to all orders. Set \\[ R_n(x)=\\sum_{k=n+1}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R, \\] which is called the reminder of the Taylor series \\[ \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k. \\] If \\[ \\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} R_n(x)=0 \\] for \\(\\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R\\), then \\(f(x)\\) is the sum of the Taylor series on the interval, that is \\[ f(x)=\\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty \\dfrac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k,\\quad\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|&lt;R. \\] If \\(\\left|f^{n+1}{x}\\right|\\leq M\\) for \\(\\left|x-a\\right|\\leq d\\), then the reminder \\(R_n\\) satisfies the follow inequality \\[ \\left|R_n(x)\\right|\\leq \\dfrac{M}{n+1}\\left|x-a\\right|^{n+1}\\quad \\text{for}\\quad \\left|x-a\\right|\\leq d. \\] Roughly speaking, the absolute value of the reminder \\(\\left|R_n(x)\\right|\\) determines how accurate the Taylor polynomial approximation. Example 1.1 Approximate function \\(f(x)=\\sin x\\) by the degree 3 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=1\\). Solution. # Find the Taylor series. fTs:=taylor(sin(x), x = 0, 4) # Convert the Taylor series into a polynomial fTp:=convert(fTs, polynom) # Evaluate the Taylor polynomial at 1 subs(x=1, fpolyapprox) Example 2.1 Plot the function \\[ g(x)=\\begin{cases}e^{-\\frac{1}{x^2}} &amp; x\\neq 0\\\\ 0 &amp; x=0\\end{cases} \\] and its 5-th order Taylor polynomial over the domain \\([-2..2]\\). What can you conclude? Solution. # Define a piece-wisely defined function. g:=piecewise(x!=0, exp(-1/x^2), 0) # Find Taylor polynomial of degree 5. for n to 5 do T := (eval(diff(g(x), x$n), x = 0))*x^n/factorial(n)+T end do # Plot the functions plot([g,T],x=-2..2, color=[red, blue]) The graphs of the functions are shown in the picture. In the solution, x$n is a shortcut option for x, x, x, x, x in the diff command. Exercise 1.2 Approximate function \\(f(x)=e^x\\) by the degree 5 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=1\\). Exercise 5.1 Compare the function \\(y=\\sin x\\) with its degree 10 Taylor polynomial at \\(x=0\\). "]
