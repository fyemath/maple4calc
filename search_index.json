In practice, itâ€™s better to recognize the shape of a cross section, find the volume of a slice of the solid and then set up the integral. In the following, you will see some tools/commands from Maple which are very helpful to calculate the volume of a solid. In Maple, the following command, supported by the package Student[Calculus1], can be used to get the graph, the integral and the volume of the solid obtained by rotation the region bounded by \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(x)\\), \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). VolumeOfRevolution(f(x), g(x), x = a..b, opts) To learn what options does the command VolumeOfRevolution have, you may type ?VolumeOfRevolution in the Math mode and hit enter. You will see the help page. Example 1.1 Show the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^2\\) and \\(y=x\\) about \\(y\\)-axis. Set up an integral for the volume. Find the volume. Solution. 1 Load the package with(Student[Calculus1]) 1 Show the solid VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = plot) 1 Set up an integral VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = integral) 1 Find the volume VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, output = value) The outputs in Maple can be seen in the following picture Remark. 1. If you change the function to VolumeOfRevolutionTutor, you will see an interactive popup windows which does exactly the same thing. If the rotation axis is not an axis of the coordinate system, you need add the option distancefromaxis = numeric into the function. For example, if in the above example, the rotation is about \\(y=-2\\), then the Maple command should be the following VolumeOfRevolution(x^2, x, x = 0 .. 1, axis = vertical, distancefromaxis = -2, output = integral) Exercise 1.1 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^3\\), \\(x=0\\), \\(y=1\\) about \\(y\\)-axis Exercise 1.2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by \\(y=x^3\\), \\(y=0\\), \\(x=1\\) about (a) \\(y=0\\), and (b) \\(x=2\\).

["inverse-functions.html", "Chapter 2 Inverse Functions", " Chapter 2 Inverse Functions Maple package Student[Calculus1] provides the following command InversePlot(f(x), x = a..b); which graphs the original function \\(f(x)\\) and the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) together over the interval \\([a, b]\\). You will see clearly that the graphs of a function and its inverse are symmetric with respect to the line \\(y=x\\). Example 1.1 Graph the function \\(f(x)=x^3-2\\), its inverse function, and the line \\(y=x\\) over the interval \\([-2,2]\\). Find the inverse function. Solution. One way to plot the function and its inverse together is to use the following command which is supported by the package Student[Calculus1]. InversePlot(x^3-3, x = -2 .. 2) Here is the output in Maple Graph of a pair of functions inverse to each other Another way to plot the function \\(f\\) and its inverse \\(g\\) together uses the plot function. plot([f(x), g(x), x], x = -2 .. 4, y = -5 .. 5, color = [red, black, blue]) To find the inverse function, we replace \\(f(x)\\) by \\(y\\), then switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and solve for \\(y\\). In Maple, you may use the command solve(equation/inequality, variable) to solve an equation or an inequality (even system of equations/inequalities). In this example, we may find the inverse function by type in the following command. Note I have switch \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). solve(x=y^3, y) To find the derivative of the inverse function of a function \\(f\\) at a given point \\(x=a\\), we may apply the formula \\[(f^{-1})&#39;(a)=\\dfrac{1}{f&#39;(f^{-1}(a))}.\\] In Maple, we may use the following commands to calculate the value of the derivative function. Calculate the derivative of the function \\(f\\). diff(f(x), x) Find \\(f^{-1}(a)\\) which is the solution of the equaiton \\(f(x)=a\\). solve(f(x)=a, x) Plug in the formula to evaluate. eval(subs(x=f^{-1}(a), 1/f&#39;(x))) Example 2.1 Find \\((f^{-1})&#39;(0)\\), where \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\) and \\(0\\leq x\\leq \\pi\\).

Find the derivative of \\(f\\) diff(cos(x), x) Find the value of \\(f^{-1}(0)\\) solve(cos(x)=0, x) Apply the formula eval(subs(x=Pi/2, -1/sin(x))) Using Maple, we find \\((f^{-1})&#39;(0)=-1\\). Exercise 1.2 1. Graph the function \\(f(x)=3+2\\sin x\\), its inverse function, and the line \\(y=x\\) over the interval \\([-2,2]\\). Find the value \\((f^{-1})&#39;(5)\\). "],
["logarithmic-and-exponential-functions.html", "Chapter 3 Logarithmic and Exponential Functions 3.1 Basic properties and graphs 3.2 Differentiation and integration", " Chapter 3 Logarithmic and Exponential Functions 3.1 Basic properties and graphs The natural logarithmic function \\(y=\\ln(x)\\) is defined by \\(\\ln(x)=\\int_1^x\\frac{1}{t}\\mathrm{d} t\\). The natural exponential function \\(y=e^x\\) is defined as the inverse function of \\(y=\\ln(x)\\). From the definition, we have very important identities \\[ \\ln(e^x)=x\\qquad \\text{and}\\qquad e^{\\ln x}=x. \\] Using those two identities, we may define general exponential functions and general logarithmic function, and deduce the Law of Logarithms and Law of Exponents. For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we have \\(b^x=(e^{\\ln b})^x=e^{x\\ln b}\\). For any positive number \\(b\\ne 1\\), we define \\(y=\\log_bx\\) to be the inverse function of \\(y=b^x\\) By solving \\(x=b^y\\) for \\(y\\), we find that \\(\\log_bx=\\dfrac{\\ln x}{\\ln b}\\). This identity is called the change of base property. How do graphs of logarithmic functions and exponential functions look like? Example 1.1 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\ln x, \\qquad y=e^x, \\qquad y=2^x, \\qquad y=\\log_2x, y=x. \\] Solution. In Maple, the logarithm \\(\\log_bx\\) is given by log[b](x). When \\(b=e\\), you simply use ln(x) for \\(\\ln x\\). When \\(b=10\\), you may also use log(x) or log10(x) for \\(\\log_{10}x\\). The exponent \\(b^x\\) is given by b^x in Maple. When \\(b=e\\), you may also use exp(x) to represent \\(e^x\\). To graph the functions together with different colors, we use the following command plot([ln(x), exp(x), 2^x, log[2](x), x], x=-5..5, color=[blue, green, purple, yellow, red]) Here is the output Graph of some logarithmic and exponential functions Exercise 3.1 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\log_3x, \\qquad y=3^x, \\qquad y=(1/3)^x, \\qquad y=\\log_{1/3}x. \\] Find the pairs that are symmetric to each other with respect to a certain line. Exercise 1.1 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=0.5^x, \\qquad y=2^x, \\qquad y=5^x. \\] Describe the monotonicity (increasing/decreasing) of the functions? Fix an input \\(x\\). Describe how \\(y\\)-values change when bases changes from small number to bigger number? Exercise 1.2 Graph the following functions together. \\[ y=\\log_{0.5}x, \\qquad y=\\log_2x, \\qquad y=\\log_{5}x. \\] Describe the monotonicity (increasing/decreasing) of the functions? Fix an input \\(x\\). Describe how \\(y\\)-values change when bases changes from small number to bigger number? 3.2 Differentiation and integration In Maple, one way to do differentiation and integration is to use the Calculus Palette on the left side. Calculus Palette in Maple The other way is to use the commands diff(f(x), x) , int(f(x), x), and int(f(x), x=a..b). Supported by the Student[Calculus1] package, Maple also provides the tutor commands DiffTutor() and IntTutor() which can show step-by-step solution of differentiation and integration. Note you may also access tutor commands from the Start page (click the home button in the toolbar and look for Calculus). Example 3.1 Find \\(y&#39;\\), where \\(y=\\ln \\left(x^{3}+5x+1\\right)\\). Solution. Using diff: diff(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x) We get \\[ y&#39;=\\dfrac{3x^{2}+5}{x^{3}+5 x+1}. \\] Type in (assume that with(Student[Calculus1]) was run) DiffTutor(ln(x^3+5*x+1), x) and hit enter you will see By click Next Step or All Steps you will see detailed solution with rules used. Example 3.2 Evaluate the integral \\[ \\int\\dfrac{e^x-1}{e^x+1}\\mathrm{d} x. \\] Solution. Using int: int((exp(x)-1)/(exp(x)+1), x) We get \\[ \\int\\dfrac{e^x-1}{e^x+1}\\mathrm{d} x=2 \\ln \\left(\\mathrm{e}^{x}+1\\right)- x+C. \\] Type in (assume that with(Student[Calculus1]) was run) IntTutor((exp(x)-1)/(exp(x)+1), x) and hit enter you will see By click Next Step or All Steps you will see detailed solution with rules used.

["solve-differential-equations.html", "Chapter 4 Solve differential equations", " Chapter 4 Solve differential equations In Maple, you may solve the equation \\(y&#39;(x)=k y(x) + c\\) (which is called an ODE) using the command dsolve({ics, eq}), where ics stands for initial condition \\(y(0)=c\\) and eq stands for the differential equation. Without the ics, dsolve will provide a general solution. Example 1.1 Find the function \\(f(x)\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\(f&#39;(x)=k f(x)\\) with \\(f(0)=5\\) and \\(f(2)=3\\). Solution. Use the following command dsolve({f(0)=5, f&#39;(x)=k f(x)}) we get \\(f(x)=5e^{kx}\\). To find \\(k\\), we solve the equation \\(3=5e^{2k}\\) by solve(3=5*e^(2*k), k) which shows that \\(k=\\frac{\\ln3-\\ln5}{2}\\approx -0.255\\). Here we use evalf(%) (% represents the previous result) to get the approximation. So the function \\(f\\) is given by \\[ f(x)=5e^{\\frac{x(\\ln3-\\ln5)}{2}}\\approx 5e^{-0.255x}. \\] Exercise 3.1 Find the function \\(y\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\(y&#39;(x)=k y(x)\\) with \\(y(0)=2\\) and \\(y(5)=11\\).
